## About this Project
In this repo, we implement an approach which reduce the depth of quantum circuit specific is CNOT gate

## Installation
To execute this repo, please create a virtual environments
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Then install some modules
```
pip install numpy
pip install random
pip install copy
```
## Usage
The command execute this Greedy algorithm
```
python3 ImprovedGreedy.py
```
## Result
The algorithm would generate the CNOT synthesized result that record in files
